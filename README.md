# Teochew NLP Project 
This project is created to explore the character pronounciations in the Teochew dialect, a member of the Min language family. The folder called src/ is where my main code resides. The dataset I used is taken from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/3534942#.XjecwlNKgWo). 

Update:
I made a blog post about this project on https://sugarc0de.github.io/dialect-nlp2/
